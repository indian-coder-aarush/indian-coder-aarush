# 👋 Hi, I'm Shirpewar  

💡 I’m an AI developer who loves building things from scratch—whether it’s deep learning frameworks, AI-powered tools, or experimental projects.  
I enjoy exploring the internals of ML/DL and turning ideas into working systems.

## 🚀 My Projects  

### 🔹 [3D Printing Ordering Website](#)  
A web app where users can upload designs and order 3D prints.  
- Built to streamline the ordering process for makers and hobbyists.  
- Includes file handling, order management, and pricing logic.  

---

### 🔹 [Yantrashiksha](#)  
A deep learning framework built **from the ground up**.  
- Implements **layers, models, tensors, backpropagation, autograd**.  
- Includes a **Tensor Core in C++** with Python bindings via **pybind11**.  
- My attempt to truly understand what goes under the hood of PyTorch/TensorFlow.  

---

### 🔹 [Classical-ML-Models](#)  
Implementations of classical ML algorithms **from scratch**.  
- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and more.  
- Focus on understanding math → code.  
- Includes visualizations and testing.  

---

### 🔹 [Learning](#)  
A playground repo for:  
- Experimentation with new ideas.  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
- Learning-by-doing and quick prototypes.  

---

### 🔹 Block AI *(private)*  
A **drag-and-drop system** to design AI models visually.  
- Think Scratch/Node-RED but for machine learning.  
- Goal: make AI model building more **intuitive and accessible**.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools I Use
- **Languages**: Python, C++, JavaScript  
- **ML/DL**: PyTorch, NumPy, scikit-learn  
- **Other**: Unity, Flask, SQL, pybind11

## 🌱 Currently Exploring
- Building custom AI agents inside Unity.  
- Smarter experiment frameworks (hyperparameter tuning, automation).  
- Advanced data analysis workflows.
